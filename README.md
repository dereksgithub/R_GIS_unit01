# R GIS Learning Unit 01
This is the first chapter for my learning note for GIS-R.

Unit 01 covers basic model and data types and some useful packages.
It also contains some R and Rmarkdown review notes.

The project contains multiple rmd notebooks and r scripts for R-GIS learning 
and reviewing.

Section 1 will be R packages review.

Section 2 describes R-sf data models.

Also included are some simple r scripts, in several r files:

visualization_prac: is dedicated for my review on r visualization packages, including:
ggplot2, echarts4r, etc.

r_review: this one focuses on tidyverse and other r data wrangling techniques.
